**Project Title:** Laptop Price Predictor using Machine Learning

**Project Objective:** Predicting Laptop Prices

**Overview:** In this project, our goal is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the price of a laptop based on its specifications. We will build a user-friendly website or application that uses this model to provide real-time price estimates based on user-inputted features such as brand, processor, RAM, storage, and more.

# Project Details

**Input Data:** The web or application will take various specifications and features of a laptop as input to predict its price. These inputs include:
- **Company:** The brand or manufacturer of the laptop (e.g., Dell, HP, Lenovo).
- **Type Name:** The type or category of the laptop (e.g., Ultrabook, Notebook, Gaming).
- **Inches:** The size of the laptop's screen in inches.
- **Screen Resolution:** The display resolution (e.g., 1920x1080, 1366x768).
- **CPU:** The processor model or brand (e.g., Intel Core i5, AMD Ryzen 7).
- **RAM:** The amount of memory (e.g., 8GB, 16GB).
- **Memory:** The storage configuration (e.g., HDD, SSD, or hybrid).
- **GPU:** The graphics processing unit used (e.g., NVIDIA, Intel HD).
- **Operating System (OpSys):** The operating system installed (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux).
- **Weight:** The weight of the laptop in kilograms.


**Machine Learning Model:** We will develop and train a machine learning model using various laptop data. This model will learn to analyze the given specifications and accurately predict the estimated market price of a laptop.

**Dataset:** The dataset comprises of over by over details of matches and runs from 2008 to 2020.The dataset consists of detailed information about various laptops, including their technical specifications, features, and prices. It includes attributes such as brand, processor, RAM, storage type, GPU, screen resolution, operating system, and more.

**Dataset Used:** data.csv

**Dataset Source:** Kaggle Website

**Dataset Link:** [ipl_data.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/code/vinothkannaece/laptop-price-prediction/input)

**Dataset Columns:** Dataset columns are given below:
- **Company:** The brand or manufacturer of the laptop (e.g., Dell, HP, Lenovo).
- **Type Name:** The type or category of the laptop (e.g., Ultrabook, Notebook, Gaming).
- **Inches:** The size of the laptop's screen in inches.
- **Screen Resolution:** The display resolution (e.g., 1920x1080, 1366x768).
- **CPU:** The processor model or brand (e.g., Intel Core i5, AMD Ryzen 7).
- **RAM:** The amount of memory (e.g., 8GB, 16GB).
- **Memory:** The storage configuration (e.g., HDD, SSD, or hybrid).
- **GPU:** The graphics processing unit used (e.g., NVIDIA, Intel HD).
- **Operating System (OpSys):** The operating system installed (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux).
- **Weight:** The weight of the laptop in kilograms.
- **Price:** The price of laptop ((target variable).

**User-Friendly Web or App:** To make laptop price predictions easily accessible, we will develop a simple and user-friendly web or desktop application. The interface will allow users to input various laptop specifications—such as brand, processor, RAM, and storage—and receive an instant and accurate price estimate based on the trained machine learning model.

**Conclusion:** By combining machine learning techniques with a user-friendly interface, our project aims to simplify and enhance the laptop buying or selling experience. This tool will assist consumers, tech enthusiasts, and retailers in making informed decisions by providing quick and accurate price estimates based on laptop specifications. It adds practical value by helping users compare options, budget effectively, and better understand the laptop market.
