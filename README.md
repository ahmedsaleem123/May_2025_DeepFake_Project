**Project Title:** Laptop Price Predictor using Machine Learning

**Project Objective:** Predicting Laptop Prices

**Overview:** In this project, our goal is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the price of a laptop based on its specifications. We will build a user-friendly website or application that uses this model to provide real-time price estimates based on user-inputted features such as brand, processor, RAM, storage, and more.

# Project Details

**Input Data:** The web or application will take various specifications and features of a laptop as input to predict its price. These inputs include:
-  **Company:** The brand or manufacturer of the laptop (e.g., Dell, HP, Lenovo).
- **Type Name:** The type or category of the laptop (e.g., Ultrabook, Notebook, Gaming).
- **Inches:** The size of the laptop's screen in inches.
- **Screen Resolution:** The display resolution (e.g., 1920x1080, 1366x768).
- **CPU:** The processor model or brand (e.g., Intel Core i5, AMD Ryzen 7).
- **RAM:** The amount of memory (e.g., 8GB, 16GB).
- **Memory:** The storage configuration (e.g., HDD, SSD, or hybrid).
- **GPU:** The graphics processing unit used (e.g., NVIDIA, Intel HD).
- **Operating System (OpSys):** The operating system installed (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux).
- **Weight:** The weight of the laptop in kilograms.
